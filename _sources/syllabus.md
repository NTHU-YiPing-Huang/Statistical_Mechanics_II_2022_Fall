# Syllabus for Statistical Mechanics (II) -- PHYS522000

[//]: <> (> 盡信書不如無書。--孟子 道可道，非常道。--老子The quotes above are very elegant descriptions about the attitude of learning. If one completely believe what a book says, it is better not to read any books. Any books should not become an obstacles for thinking. )

## Basic information
* Time: Thursday 13:20-16:20
* Classroom: Physics building, Room 208 
* Instructor: Yi-Ping Huang

	* We encourage everyone to interact in English. If some conceptual questions are difficult to be described in English, one can ask the question in Mandarin, and I will translate that into English. If I forgot to do that, please remind me to do so.
* Teaching method: Lectures with live video streaming. 
* Please join the google classroom.
	* Course code: please contact the instructor.
	* Course-related information(*e.g.*, homework) will be posted in the google classroom.
	* Access to the live video streaming will be provided in the google classroom.

## Homework policies

* It is **encouraged** to discuss homework or the content of the lectures with your classmates. However, the point of discussion is to form one's own opinion instead of following someone's idea. **Don't copy the homework**.
* Copied homework will get no points. That is, we will use a very one-sided rule. If two homework looks very similar, both of them get zero points.
* Copied homework from the **internet** is also **disallowed**. If the homework looks similar to any online resources: solution manual or anything, the homework will also get zero points.
* I will put the pdf file of the homework on google classroom. The pdf file will specify the due date of the homework. One-day delay is allowed (**By Friday 5 pm**). If you need more time to finish the homework, please send an email to me and explain why you need an extension and when you expect to turn in your homework. Late homework(**within a week**) without reasoning gets 70% of the scores. Late homework without reasoning for more than a week will get 0 points.
* **The purpose of homework is to help you learn the subject.** Please give yourself some time to think independently first, then discuss with your classmates or TA. TA has no responsibility to do the homework for you. **Please start doing the homework early.**

### How to do the homework 
* Bring your pen, blank paper, and the assignment. Find a place where you can think. Start working on the assignment. Think about the meaning of the problem. If you don't know what to do, that's fine. Propose possible ways to yourself first. Develop the logic to solve the problem first, ignore the details of the calculation. Focus on the strategy of your approach. 
* Then, start to carry out your strategy. If you get stuck, found you are confused about some concept. Check the note and see if you can figure out what's going on. 
* If you still cannot figure it out, try to describe your confusion to yourself. Try to narrow down the concept that you don't feel you understand. Construct specific examples to show why it is confusing to you. Then you can bring your confusion to discuss with your classmates or TAs. 
	```{admonition} Example (A possible workflow of doing homework)
	:class: tip
	**Assignment**: Calculate the specific heat of model X:
	
	1. What is the physical meaning of specific heat? Did we learn how to calculate specific heat during the course? Thermodynamic quantities are usually related to thermodynamic potential. Can we calculate the free energy of the system and get specific heat from there?
	2. What is model X? What is the energy spectrum of model X? How knowing the energy spectrum helps me to construct the expression of thermodynamic potential?
	3. If I find a way to derive the thermodynamic potential and if I understand how to calculate specific heat from thermodynamic potential. Then I should be able to solve this problem. So I should understand how to construct thermodynamic potential from scratch and how the thermodynamic potential is related to the specific heat.
	4. Carry out the detail of the calculation.

## Textbook

None

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge in statistical mechanics (I)

## Course Description

We will go beyond the non-interacting systems and study the concept of renormalization group and effective theory. Once we have a complete understanding of the RG. We will study some important models and use them to explore the study of phases of matter in classical and quantum interacting systems.
